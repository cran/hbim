{\Large Mathematical and Computational Supplement to 
``Multicomponent,single target vaccines: benefits and limitations 
for practical vaccine design derived from mathematical models''}

by Allan Saul and Michael P. Fay \\
\today



\section*{Summary}


This supplement gives the details of the calculations that produce 
the figures in the paper.  This document is part of an R package 
called \pname\ which contains all the data and software needed to 
reproduce the calculations for the figures of the paper.

\section{Introduction}




The document is part of an R package that allows reproducible 
research as discussed in Gentleman (2005) and Gentleman and Temple 
Lang (2007). With this package, called \pname , a researcher can 
redo all the calculations done to produce the figures in the main 
paper. Further one can extract the R computer code used to create 
those Figures and modify it as desired. 

Here is an outline of this document. The main part of the document gives the overall
details of the calculations in mathematical notation, while Appendix~\ref{app:Rcode} 
gives the details of the computer programs used in  R package.  
In Section~\ref{sec:defn} we define the 95\% range and 95\% 
fold-range. This is a simple function of the standard deviation of 
the log of the transformed antibody responses, denoted $\sigma$.  
In Section~\ref{sec:estsd} we give the algorithm for estimating 
$\sigma$ (the standard deviation of the log transformed responses)   
from the 95\% confidence interval of the mean. 
In Section~\ref{sec:meanRR} we show how we calculate the relative risk and the expected relative 
risk. In Section~\ref{sec:pp} we show how we calculate the percent protected from this model. 

Appendix~\ref{app:Rcode} gives details of how the calculations were done, and information on how to redo the calculations
in the R programming language using the \pname\ package. R is an open source freeware statstical programming language 
(R Development Core Team, 2007). Within Appendix~\ref{app:Rcode} we reproduce many of the figures of the main paper.
Appendix~\ref{app:logn} gives some basic properties of the lognormal distribution. 

\section{Definition of 95\% Range}
\label{sec:defn}


Let $y_i =\log_{10}(x_i)$, where $x_i$ is the antibody level in the 
i$^{th}$ subject. Let $Y_i$ be the random variable associated with 
$y_i$. We assume that the $Y_i$ are independently normally 
distributed  with mean $\theta$ and variance $\sigma^2$.  Thus, 
$\frac{Y_i - \theta}{\sigma}$ is distributed standard normal.
Let $\Phi^{-1}(q)$ be the $q$th quantile of the standard normal 
distribution. Thus,$Pr[\Phi^{-1}(.025) \leq \frac{Y_i -\theta}{\sigma} 
\leq \Phi^{-1}(.975)]=.95$, and under this model, we are 95\% sure 
that a random log transformed antibody level is between $\sigma 
\Phi^{-1}(.025)+\theta$    and $\sigma \Phi^{-1}(.975)+\theta$. The 95\% 
range on the log transformed scale is then
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{95\% Range} & = & \sigma \left\{ 
\Phi^{-1}(.975)-\Phi^{-1}(.025)\right\} = 3.92 \sigma.
\end{eqnarray*}
On the untransformed scale the 95\% range is the ratio of the upper 
to lower 95\% confidence limits, (also known as the {\it 95\% 
fold-range}) 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{10^{\sigma \Phi^{-1}(.975)+\theta} }{ 10^{\sigma 
\Phi^{-1}(.025)+\theta} } & = & 10^{\sigma \left\{ 
\Phi^{-1}(.975)-\Phi^{-1}(.025)\right\} } = 10^{3.92\sigma}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\section{Estimating the Standard Deviation of the Log Transformed 
Responses}
\label{sec:estsd}

As before let $y_i =\log_{10}(x_i)$, where $x_i$ is the antibody 
level in the $i$th subject. Suppose there are $n$ subjects measured.  
The usual unbiased estimator of the variance (i.e., standard 
deviation squared) is
\begin{eqnarray*}
s^2 & = & \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\bar{y}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i$ is the mean of the 
$y_i$ values.  In the literature often this unbiased estimate is not 
given, but the 95\% confidence interval is given.  The usual 95\%
confidence interval based on the log scale calculated by the
standard formula is based on either the t-distribution or the normal distribution, i.e., is either,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bar{y} \pm \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} t^{-1}_{n-1}(.975)
\end{eqnarray*}
where $t^{-1}_{n-1}(q)$
is the qth quantile of the t distribution with n-1 degrees of
freedom, or is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bar{y} \pm \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \Phi^{-1}(.975)
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\Phi^{-1}(q)$
is the qth quantile of the standard normal distribution (see e.g., Casella and Berger, 2002, p. 429).
Note that  $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}   t^{-1}_{n-1}(q) = \Phi^{-1}(q)$ for all $q$. Thus, in practice it may not matter too much which is used. 
Here are some values for $t^{-1}_{n-1}(.975)$ for different values of $n$:

\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}
                      & $n=10$ & $n=20$ & $n=50$ & $n=100$ & $n=200$ & $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}$ \\
$t^{-1}_{n-1}(.975)$  &  2.228 & 2.086 & 2.009 & 1.984 & 1.972 & 1.960 \\
\end{tabular}
 
Given
the 95\% confidence interval (L,U)  we can solve for s. When the t-distribution was used for the confidence interval can find $s$ by:
\begin{eqnarray}
s & = & \frac{ \sqrt{n} \left( U-L \right) }{ 2 t^{-1}_{n-1}(.975)
} \label{eq:sbyt}
\end{eqnarray}
Similarly when the normal distribution was used, 
\begin{eqnarray}
s & = & \frac{ \sqrt{n} \left( U-L \right) }{ 2 \Phi^{-1}(.975)
} = \frac{ \sqrt{n} \left( U-L \right) }{ 3.92}  \label{eq:sbyz}
\end{eqnarray}

Since the confidence interval by the t-distribution is more common, we used that for all the calculations in this document. 

\section{Calculating Mean Relative Risk}
\label{sec:meanRR}

We use a Hill function for relative risk for a single antibody concentration. Let the antibody level for the $i$th subject 
at the $j$th immunogen be $x_{ij}$, then the associated relative risk is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
RR_{ij} & = & \frac{ 1}{1+\left( \frac{x_{ij}}{\beta_j } \right)^{a_j}}
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\beta_j$ is the antibody required to give a relative risk of $0.5$,
and $a_j$ is a slope parameter. Let $d_{ij}=x_{ij}/\beta_j$ denote the antibody level standardized by $\beta_j$, so that 
$d_{ij}=1$ is the antibody required to give a RR of $.5$,  
$d_{ij}=.5$ is half that amount, etc.  
Let $\beta_j^*=\log_{10}(\beta_j)$ and $d_{ij}^* = \log_{10}(d_{ij})$. Further, as above, let 
$y_{ij} = \log_{10}(x_{ij})$. Then we can write $RR_{ij}$ as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
RR_{ij} & = & \frac{ 1}{1+10^{a_j \left( y_{ij} - \beta_j^* \right)  } }
\end{eqnarray*}
If we assume that $Y_{ij} \sim N(\theta_j, \sigma^2_j)$ then 
$D_{ij}^* =\log_{10}(X_{ij}/\beta_j) =  Y_{ij}-\beta_j^* \sim N(\theta_j-\beta_j^*, \sigma^2_j)$, and 
we can use the same $\sigma^2_j$ for the distribution of $D_{ij}^*$ as was used for the distribution of $Y_{ij}$. 
So the mean of $D_{ij}^*$ is $\theta_j - \beta^*_j$ and for a sample of $D_{ij}$ values, the expected geometric mean is 
$10^{\theta_j -\beta_j^*} = 10^{\theta_j}/\beta_j$.  For  example,  Figure~2 of the paper plots $10^{\theta_j -\beta_j^*}$ on the horizontal 
axis. Note that $10^{\theta_j -\beta_j^*}$ is not the expected value of $D_{ij}$ (see Appendix~\ref{app:logn}).


Based on the Bliss independence model (Greco, et al, 1995), The RR for the $i$th subject with $J$ antigen components is 
\begin{eqnarray}
RR_{i} & = & \prod_{i=1}^{J} RR_{ij}. \label{eq:RRi}
\end{eqnarray}

In order to account for possible correlation between antibody responses with different antigens we model the 
$D_{ij}^*$ as multivariate normal. Let $\mu_j=\theta_j-\beta_j^*$ so that  
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left[ \begin{array}{c} 
D^*_{i1} \\
\vdots \\
D^*_{iJ} 
\end{array} 
\right] & \sim & N({\bf \mu}, {\bf V}) =  N \left( \left[ \begin{array}{c} 
\mu_{1} \\
\vdots \\
\mu_{J} 
\end{array} 
\right], \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 
\sigma_{1}^2 & \rho \sigma_1 \sigma_2 & \cdots & \rho \sigma_1 \sigma_J \\
\rho \sigma_1 \sigma_2 & \sigma^2_2 & \cdots & \rho \sigma_2 \sigma_J \\
\vdots \\
\rho \sigma_1 \sigma_J & \rho \sigma_2 \sigma_J & \cdots & \sigma_J^2 \\
\end{array} 
\right] \right) 
\end{eqnarray*} 
where $\rho$ is the correlation between any two antigen responses on the same subject, and 
${\bf \mu}$ is the mean vector, and ${\bf V}$ is the covariance matrix. 
Let the probability density function of the multivariate normal distribution with mean ${\bf \mu}$ and 
covariance ${\bf V}$ evaluated at the $J$-dimensional point ${\bf t}$ be  $\phi({\bf t}, {\bf \mu},{\bf V})$. 
Then the expected $RR_i$ over the whole population can be calculated by the $J$ dimensional integral, 
\begin{eqnarray}
E(RR_i) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \cdots \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}   \left( \prod_{j=1}^{J} \frac{ 1}{1+10^{a_j  t_{j}   } } \right)
\phi([t_1,\ldots,t_J],{\bf \mu}, {\bf V}) \; dt_1 \; dt_2 \; \cdots dt_J
\label{eq:meanRR}
\end{eqnarray}
We can use either numberic integration or integration by simulation (see Appendix~\ref{app:Rcode} for details of which method is used 
for which integral). For a discussion on the accuracy of the integration by simulation, see the end of Section~\ref{sec:pp}.



\section{Calculating the Proportion Protected} 
\label{sec:pp}

Assume that $RR_i$ is given by equation~\ref{eq:RRi}. Suppose we consider a subject protected if $RR_i \leq r_p$. 
In our paper we use $r_p=0.10$. 


If there is only one antigen then a subject with antibody level $t_1$ is protected whenever, 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{ 1}{1+10^{a_1  t_{1}   } }  & \leq & r_p 
\end{eqnarray*}
which implies protection when $t_1 \geq \tau$, where  
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \tau =  \frac{1}{a_1} \log_{10} \left( \frac{1-r_p}{r_p} \right). 
\end{eqnarray*}
So the proportion protected in the population will be 
\begin{eqnarray}
PP(r_p) = \int_{\tau}^{\infty} \phi(t_1,{\bf \mu}, {\bf V}) \; dt_1  = 1 - \Phi(\tau,{\bf \mu}, {\bf V})
\label{eq:pp1}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Phi({\bf t},{\bf \mu}, {\bf V})$ is the cumulative normal distribution with mean ${\bf \mu}$ and variance ${\bf V}$. 

If there are two antigens then if the $i$th subject has antibody levels $t_1$ and $t_2$, that subject is protected whenever $PP_i=1$,
where  
\begin{eqnarray*}
PP_i &= & I \left\{ \left( \frac{1}{1+10^{a_1  t_1} } \right)  \left( \frac{1}{1+10^{a_2  t_2}} \right)   \leq   r_p \right\}
\end{eqnarray*}
where $I(A)=1$ when $A$ is true and 0 otherwise. 
For $J$ antigens, the expected proportion protected over the whole population can be calculated by the $J$ dimensional integral, 
\begin{eqnarray}
E(PP_i) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \cdots \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  I \left\{  \prod_{j=1}^{J} \frac{ 1}{1+10^{a_j  t_{j}   } }  \leq r_p \right\} 
\phi([t_1,\ldots,t_J],{\bf \mu}, {\bf V}) \; dt_1 \; dt_2 \; \cdots dt_J
\label{eq:meanPPj}
\end{eqnarray}
Since this integral is not smoothly changing, the numeric integration is not straightforward. An alternative is to integrate by simulation. 
In this case, since $PP_i$ is a binary random variable, we can use the properties of binomial random variable to get a bound on the integration. 
Here and in the main paper we use 5e+05 simulations to estimate these integrals.
If we do 5e+05 simulations, then we are 99.9\% sure that the simulated mean will be within 
$\pm 0.001163$ 
of the true value. 
This comes from the usual normal theory confidence interal, which is 
$mean \pm \frac{ \Phi^{-1}(.9995) P(1-P)}{\sqrt{5e+05}}$, except we set $P$,
the unknown true value of $E(PP_i)$ equal to $P=.5$ which maximizes the width of the 
confidence interval. If the true value of $P$ is close to 0 or 1 then the confidence interval will be tighter; for example, 
if our estimate of $P$ was  $.01$ then we would be 99.9\% sure that the mean would be within 
$\pm 4.6e-05$. 

Note that similar statements about the accuracy of the expected relative risk by simulation can be made. 
The $P(1-P)$ in the previous equation denotes the variance of one observation. Since relative risk is bounded by
$0$ and $1$, the maximum variance of any distribution of values between $0$ and $1$ is $.25$, the variance of the 
Bernoulli observation with probability $.5$. One can see this by noting that with that distribution, the distribution
of the responses are as spead out as they could be, with half at 0 and half at 1.

\section{How to Use the \pname\ R package}
\label{app:Rcode}

This section details how to use the \pname\ R-package, the definitive software for the paper. 
A simplified version of the model is 
also available in an Excel version (see supplementary file "Combination Model Spreadsheet.zip"). 

\subsection{Installation of R and \pname\ package}

To use the package: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download R (it is open source freeware, see  \verb@http://www.r-project.org/@) and install it. R  
runs on Windows, Linux or MacOS operating systems. In Windows, for example,  
 there is an executable installation file. Use a version of R that is  $\geq 2.5.0.$
\item Run R and install the \pname\ package. The windows version of the package is available as the supplemental file 
\verb@hbim_0.9.5.zip.@ Versions for other operating systems (e.g., Linux) will be made available on the CRAN site (\verb@http://www.r-project.org/@).  
Follow the help for your system. In Windows, save the zip file in a folder, use the drop down menus: 
{\sf packages$>$Install package(s) from local zip files....} and find the zip file in the folder where it was saved.
\item Install the \texttt{mvtnorm}  package from CRAN (\verb@http://www.r-project.org/@). 
\item Load the package. At R prompt  (denoted by $>$): 

$>$library(\pname); ?\pname\

This allows use of all functions in the package and calls up a 
help menu for each function.  
\end{enumerate}

To extract the code from the .Rnw file that produced this document, you need to find the file. 
After installation of the package, from the library subdirectory of your R directory (e.g., 
\verb@C:\R\R-2.5.0\library@), the file is at \pname\ \verb@\doc\inst\hbimdetails.Rnw@.
Then from R type \\
 \verb@Stangle("put location of file here\hbimdetails.Rnw")@. For example \\
\verb@Stangle("H:\\main\\malaria\\saul\\combination\\tex\\hbimdetails.Rnw")@. 
This will create a file called hbimdetails.R which will be put in your working R directory, which will have all the 
R code used to perform all the calculations of this document. 

\subsection{Access to Immune Response Database}

After installing the \pname\ package one can access the immune response database. Here is the code to 
access the database and printout the 35$^{th}$ observation of the database:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> data(irdata)
> irdata[35, ]
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
   RecordNum Old.Reference Reference Vaccine.and.trial.group

\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
R prints out a 35 at  the beginning of each line to denote that all the lines are on the 35th row of the irdata. 
There are many variables, and some are missing values. For the calculations of this document we are concerned with only 
a few variables. 

The variable "Reference" gives the number of the reference associated with those data. 
For the 35th observation the reference number is 5.
After installing the refs data (using \texttt{data(refs)}), we can get that reference by the command: 
refs[5]. The results will print:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Soutput}
                                                                                                                                                            5

\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
The first line is the reference. It is a long character string that does not fit on the format for this document. 
The second lines gives the list of all the references.

\subsection{Calculation of Fold-Range from 95\% Confidence 
Interval}
\label{app:estsd}

The function used to calculate the fold-range from the confidence 
interval is \texttt{calc.foldrange}. Here is an  example: suppose 
the 95\% confidence interval for the mean antibody response is 
$(65.2, 87.6)$ from $n=$203 subjects. Then here is the R code to do that calculation, followed by the results:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> calc.foldrange(203, 65.2, 87.6)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
    n lower upper     s.byt     s.byz foldrange.byt foldrange.byz
1 203  65.2  87.6 0.4633824 0.4661754      65.52782      67.20073
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
The value $s.byt$ is $s$ from equation~\ref{eq:sbyt}, and  $s.byz$ is $s$ from equation~\ref{eq:sbyz}.

We can calculate the foldrange for the entire Immune Response database, and print out the first 5 results by the following: 
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> frall <- calc.foldrange(irdata$n, irdata$GMT.95.pct.interval.low.limit, 
+     irdata$GMT.95.pct.interval.high.limit)
> frall[1:5, ]
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
    n lower upper     s.byt     s.byz foldrange.byt foldrange.byz
1 203  65.2  87.6 0.4633824 0.4661754      65.52782      67.20073
2 205  73.9  99.3 0.4658624 0.4686426      67.01114      68.71401
3 206  68.7  93.5 0.4872123 0.4901057      81.25256      83.40246
4 203 149.8 189.4 0.3680430 0.3702614      27.71419      28.27469
5 206 144.4 187.3 0.4111965 0.4136384      40.91294      41.82471
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

We can do statistics on the fold-ranges calculated from the data set. First note that there are 574 different 
data points from the data set. To explore the distribution of the fold-range values we look at some quantiles. Note the 0\% quantile is the minimum,
100\% quantile is the maximum, 50\% quantile is the median, and 95\% of the fold-range values are between the 2.5\% quantile and the 97.5\% quantile. 
Here are those values by both methods:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> quantile(frall[, "foldrange.byt"], probs = c(0, 0.025, 0.5, 0.975, 
+     1))
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
          0%         2.5%          50%        97.5%         100%

\end{Soutput}
\begin{Sinput}
> quantile(frall[, "foldrange.byz"], probs = c(0, 0.025, 0.5, 0.975, 
+     1))
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
          0%         2.5%          50%        97.5%         100%

\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
Also consider the quantiles of the standard deviation values.
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> quantile(frall[, "s.byt"], probs = c(0, 0.025, 0.5, 0.975, 1))
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
       0%      2.5%       50%     97.5%      100% 
0.1913947 0.2450334 0.4601947 0.9193417 1.2332514 
\end{Soutput}
\begin{Sinput}
> quantile(frall[, "s.byz"], probs = c(0, 0.025, 0.5, 0.975, 1))
\end{Sinput}

Note that because each estimated fold range has some variability, these quantiles calculated from the estimates will produce 
a larger middle 95\% range (i.e., smaller 2.5\% quantile and larger 97.5\% quantile) 
than the quantiles of the fold ranges that would result if it was possible to estimate each fold 
range without error. Because the only use of these quantiles is to posit a range of plausible values, we do not investigate 
the estimatation of the quantiles further. 


\subsection{Recreating Figure~1}

We redo all the figures of the main paper in this document. In order to see them in the form of the paper 
(e.g., four panels on a page for Figures~3, 4, and 5), after loading the \texttt{hbim} package, type 
for example \texttt{demo("make.figure1")}.


The details of the creation of Figure~1 of the main paper are hidden in the .Rnw file in the fig1 code chunk. 
Briefly, only studies performed on infants with more than one study per antigen are presented.
For completeness we recreate Figure~1 as Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}.


\begin{figure}
\caption{In the paper this is Figure 1.
 \label{fig:fig1} }
\includegraphics{hbimdetails-fig1}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Recreating Figure~2}
\label{app:fig2}


To create Figure~2 of the paper, we repeatedly calculate the integrals of equation~\ref{eq:meanRR} by numeric integration. 
For example, at the point $0.1$ with two component variance model, with $\sigma=0.462486395398815$, 
we assume that ${\bf \mu} = [0.1, 0.1]$ and 
\[
{\bf V} =\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
\sigma^2 & 0 \\
0 & \sigma^2 \\ 
\end{array}
\right].
\]

Here is the R code to calculate that. First note that :
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> V <- matrix(c(sigmas[2], 0, 0, sigmas[2]), 2, 2)
> V
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
          [,1]      [,2]
[1,] 0.4624864 0.0000000
[2,] 0.0000000 0.4624864
\end{Soutput}
\begin{Sinput}
> mu <- c(0.1, 0.1)
> hbrr(mu, V)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] 0.2117964
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

For Figure~2 we repeat these calculations at many points.
We calculated the expected relative risk over different values of $\sigma$ (see equation~\ref{eq:meanRR}), 
where for each calculation of that equation we have let all the $\sigma$ values be equal (i.e., $\sigma=\sigma_1=\cdots = \sigma_3$). 
For different calculations of equation~\ref{eq:meanRR}, the value of $\sigma$ would change. 
The different values of $\sigma$ used in the different calculations 
are determined in the PreliminaryCalculation code chunk, by the \texttt{SIGMAS} object.
Specifically, 
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> SIGMAS
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] 0.2434337 0.4624864 0.9436321
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
Since the creation of the data took several hours, we have saved it as a data set called \texttt{deff.sigma}.
In R, one can do the plot by: 
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> data(deff.sigma)
> plotlogm.resp(deff.sigma)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
In this document it is labeled as Figure~\ref{fig:pfig2}.

\begin{figure}
\caption{In the paper this is Figure 2.
sigma= 0.243433684742747  is  green,sigma= 0.462486395398815  is  blue,sigma= 0.943632136486441  is  red
 \label{fig:pfig2} }
\includegraphics{hbimdetails-fig2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Creating Figure 3a}

In order to create Figure~3a, we use the function, \texttt{plotresp.mix} on the \texttt{deff.sigma} data created 
using the function \texttt{eff.sigma}. 

We recreate that figure as 
Figure~\ref{fig:3a} of this document.

\begin{figure}
\caption{Figure 3a of Paper.
sigma= 0.243433684742747  is  green,sigma= 0.462486395398815  is  blue,sigma= 0.943632136486441  is  red
 \label{fig:3a} }
\includegraphics{hbimdetails-fig3a}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Creating Figure 3b}

We now explain each point in Figure~3b. In Figure~\ref{fig:e3bplot} of this document, we plot the lines from the single 
antigen and the two antigen combination from Figure~2 of the main paper evaluated at $\sigma=0.243433684742747$. 
Consider an efficacy for a single antigen alone at $e_1$. There is an associated antigen level for a single 
antigen, $a_1$. Then if we had two antigens both at the level $a_1$ then the efficacy would be $e_2$. In order to get efficacy equal 
to $e_2$ with a single antigen, we need an amount of $a_2$ of a single antigen. Each point in the plot for Figure~3b from the paper 
is $e_1$ on the horizontal axis vs. $a_2/a_1$ on the vertical axis. 
The plot function uses the \texttt{equiv.increase} function. Here is the equivalent increase for the model with 
$\sigma_1=\sigma_2=SIGMAS[2]=0.462486395398815$ for both the efficacy and the percent protected. 
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> D <- deff.sigma
> equiv.increase(D$mu, D$out1[, 2], D$mu, D$out2[, 2], 0.5)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}

\begin{figure}
\caption{Explanatory Plot for Figure 3b of Paper.
 \label{fig:e3bplot} }

\includegraphics{hbimdetails-explanationfig3b}
\end{figure}

We recreate Figure 3b as Figure~\ref{fig:3b} of this document. 

\begin{figure}
\caption{Figure 3b of Paper.
sigma= 0.243433684742747  is  green,sigma= 0.462486395398815  is  blue,sigma= 0.943632136486441  is  red
 \label{fig:3b} }
\includegraphics{hbimdetails-fig3b}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Percent Protected and Associated Figures}

In order to calculate percent protected we use the function, we use the function \texttt{pp.sigma} 
(see help for that function). 
Since the creation of the data took several hours, we have saved it as a data set called \texttt{dpp.sigma}.
To have acces to that data use \texttt{data(dpp.sigma)}. 
Although not included in the main paper we can plot the percent protected using the \texttt{plotlogm.resp} 
function as: \\
 \texttt{plotlogm.resp(dpp.sigma,YLIM=c(0,100),YLAB="Percent Protected")} \\
 which is 
plotted as Figure~\ref{fig:logmean.pp.sigma}.

\begin{figure}
\caption{Standardized Geometric Mean Antibody by Percent Protected.
sigma= 0.243433684742747  is  green,sigma= 0.462486395398815  is  blue,sigma= 0.943632136486441  is  red
 \label{fig:logmean.pp.sigma} }
\includegraphics{hbimdetails-figppsigma}
\end{figure}



To create Figure~3c of the main paper, 
we use: \\  
 \texttt{plotresp.mix(dpp.sigma,XYLIM=c(0,100),RLAB="\% Protected by")}. \\
 It is Figure~\ref{fig:3c} of this document.

\begin{figure}
\caption{Figure 3c of Paper.
sigma= 0.243433684742747  is  green,sigma= 0.462486395398815  is  blue,sigma= 0.943632136486441  is  red
 \label{fig:3c} }
\includegraphics{hbimdetails-fig3c}
\end{figure}

To create Figure~3d of the main paper, there are some issues. First recall how Figure~3b of the main paper was calculated 
(Figure~\ref{fig:3b} of this document). Compare Figure~\ref{fig:e3bplot} and \ref{fig:logmean.pp.sigma} of this document. 
One can see how many of the points will be very hard to estimate because the dose response curves become essentially flat
at low and high percent protected values. 
Figure~\ref{fig:firsttry3d} of this document is a first try and Figure~3d of the main paper.  

\begin{figure}
\caption{First Try at Figure 3d of Paper.
sigma= 0.243433684742747  is  green,sigma= 0.462486395398815  is  blue,sigma= 0.943632136486441  is  red
 \label{fig:firsttry3d} }
\includegraphics{hbimdetails-figfirsttry3d}
\end{figure}

We do not print the values which are very hard to estimate. 
Return to Figure~\ref{fig:e3bplot}. In this case, $e_1$ and $e_2$ represent percent protection. 
We limit the lines to cases where $0.01< e_2<99.9$. 
This is how we create Figure~3d of the main paper; it is Figure~\ref{fig:3d} of this document. 
We use those same limits for Figures~4d and 5d of the main paper
(i.e., Figures~\ref{fig:4d} and \ref{fig:5d} of this document).
  

\begin{figure}
\caption{Figure 3d of Paper.

 \label{fig:3d} }
\includegraphics{hbimdetails-fig3d}
\end{figure}





\subsection{Creating Figures~4a,b,c and d}


In order to create Figures~4 of the main paper we created data using the function \texttt{eff.mu} and \texttt{pp.mu}
(see help for those functions). Essentially, we  calculated the expected relative risk over different values of $\mu$ 
(see equation~\ref{eq:meanRR}). For the single component vaccine we use the $\mu$ value that can be read from the plots
as $10^\mu$. 
For the second and third component of the vaccine we set $\mu_2=\mu_3=\mu_1+\log10(FACTOR)$, where FACTOR is some factor (1/2, 1/3, etc.).
In the plots, the median antibody plotted is $10^{\mu_1}$.  We used these same
values of $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ to calculate the percent protected.  
The different values of that factor used in the different calculations 
are determined in the PreliminaryCalculation code chunk, by the \texttt{FACTORS} object.
Specifically, 
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> FACTORS
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] 0.1000000 0.3333333 0.5000000 1.0000000
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}


We create the figures similarly to Figures~3 of the main paper (see above). 
In Figures~\ref{fig:logmean.eff.mu} and \ref{fig:logmean.pp.mu} we create figures similar to Figure~2 of the main 
paper, except with the \texttt{deff.mu} and \texttt{dpp.mu} output. 
The Figures~4a, 4b, 4c, and 4d of the main paper 
are labeled Figures~\ref{fig:4a}, \ref{fig:4b}, \ref{fig:4c}, and \ref{fig:4d}  in this document.

\includegraphics{hbimdetails-fig4d}

\subsection{Creating Figures~5a,b,c and d}


In order to create Figures~5 of the main paper we created data using the function \texttt{eff.rho} and \texttt{pp.rho}
(see help for those functions). Essentially, we  calculated the expected relative risk over different values of $\rho$ 
(see equation~\ref{eq:meanRR}). For the single component vaccine there is no $\rho$ parameter, but there is one in the 
two and  three component vaccines. 
The different values of $\rho$ used in the different calculations 
are determined in the PreliminaryCalculation code chunk, by the \texttt{RHOS} object.
Specifically, 
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> RHOS
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] -0.50 -0.25  0.00  0.25  0.50  0.75  1.00
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
There were some integration problems so we calculated the expected efficacy values by 
simulation using 5e+05 simulations. Since efficacy is bounded by $0$ and $1$,
similar (but not equivalent) statements about the accuracy of efficacy can be made about these simulations as were made about simulation
of the percent protected in Section~\ref{sec:pp}.

We create the figures similarly to Figures~3 of the main paper (see above). 
In Figures~\ref{fig:logmean.eff.rho} and \ref{fig:logmean.pp.rho} we create figures similar to Figure~2 of the main 
paper, except with the \texttt{deff.rho} and \texttt{dpp.rho} output. 
The Figures~5a, 5b, 5c, and 5d of the main paper 
are labeled  Figures~\ref{fig:5a}, \ref{fig:5b}, \ref{fig:5c}, and \ref{fig:5d}  in this document.

\section{Lognormal Distribution}
\label{app:logn}

Here are some properties of the lognormal distribution (see e.g., Antle, 1985):

Suppose that $Y=\log_e(X)$ has a normal distribution with mean equal 
$\mu$ and variance equal $\sigma^2$. Then X has a lognormal 
distribution with mean equal to
\begin{itemize}
\item $E(X) = \exp \left(\mu + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \right)$      and
\item $Var(X) = \exp \left(2 \mu + \sigma^2 \right) \left\{ 
\exp(\sigma^2)-1 \right\}$
\end{itemize}

This means that the coefficient of variation of X (denoted $CV(X)$) 
is
\begin{eqnarray*}
CV(X) & =& \frac{ \sqrt{Var(X)}}{E(X)} = \frac{ 
\sqrt{\exp(2\mu+\sigma^2} \left\{\exp(\sigma^2)-1 \right\} 
}{\exp\left( \mu + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \right) } = 
\sqrt{\exp(\sigma^2)-1}
\end{eqnarray*}

For the lognormal distribution $\sigma$ is sometimes known as the 
shape parameter. If we let $c=$coefficient of variation, then
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sigma^2 & = & \log_e(c^2 +1)
\end{eqnarray*}

Now suppose that $Z = \log_{10}(X) =  Y \log_{10}(e)$. Then Z has 
normal distribution with mean equal to $\mu \log_{10}(e)$ and 
variance equal to $\log_{10}(2e)\sigma^2$ and the coefficient of 
variation is the same as above. This is like a rescaling of the 
units on the log scale. We can go through a change to those units if 
we want; it does not change the basic relationships between means and 
variances.

\section{Variability of Sample Standard Deviation of Log transformed 
Responses}

Note that if we have many trials, and each estimates the standard 
deviation of the log transformed responses as above. Even with 
sample sizes as large as 100, there is still considerable 
variability.  Suppose that the true $\sigma$ was 1, then (99)s2 is 
distributed as a chi-squared distribution with 99 degrees of 
freedom. Here is the distribution of the s estimates when each trial 
has $\sigma=1$ and either 100, 25, or 10 observations:
